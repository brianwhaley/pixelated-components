1. Brand Visual Identity
The "Lowcountry Estate" Palette
To capture the South Carolina feel, we are moving away from "bright lawnmower green" (which signals basic mowing) toward deep, rich tones that signal established wealth, history, and hardscaping materials.

Primary Color: Live Oak Deep Green

Hex: #1F3A26

Usage: Logos, heavy headers, footer backgrounds. Represents stability and year-round health.

Secondary Color: Spanish Moss

Hex: #8A9A91

Usage: Sub-headers, icons, secondary buttons. A soft, gray-green that evokes the SC coastline.

Accent 1: Lowcountry Brick

Hex: #A35C48

Usage: Call-to-action buttons (CTAs), highlights. Represents the hardscaping/masonry focus (red clay and historic brick).

Accent 2: Marsh Grass Gold

Hex: #C5B386

Usage: Thin lines, borders, premium badges. Adds the "High-End" luxury feel without being shiny gold.

Background: Oyster Shell White

Hex: #F4F3EF

Usage: Main page backgrounds. Not a sterile clinical white; a warm, natural cream.

Text Color: Wrought Iron

Hex: #2C2C2C

Usage: All body text. Softer than pure black for better readability.

Typography
The font pairing mixes tradition (SC history) with modern efficiency (Commercial reliability).

Headings: Playfair Display

A high-contrast serif font. It feels editorial, expensive, and classic.

Body Text: Lato

A clean, geometric sans-serif. It is easy to read on mobile and looks professional and corporate.

2. Logo & Icon Concepts
Since the focus is on structure (Hardscape) and magnitude (Trees/Commercial), the logo should be substantial, not wispy.

Visual Motif: A broad, spreading Live Oak silhouette.

Option A: Horizontal Version (Website Header/Invoices)
Layout: The icon sits to the left of the text.

Icon: A solid, stylized silhouette of a Live Oak tree with a thick trunk (representing strength) and wide canopy. The roots are slightly visible, turning into geometric blocks to symbolize hardscaping.

Text: "OAKTREE" in Playfair Display (All Caps, wide tracking) in Deep Green. Below it, smaller, "LANDSCAPING" in Lato (All Caps) in Spanish Moss color.

Option B: Vertical Version (Truck Doors/Uniforms/Social Media)
Layout: Stacked.

Icon: The same tree icon, but enclosed in a thin, elegant circle (Gold color) or a hexagon (to suggest paving/structure).

Text: "OAKTREE" is stacked directly underneath the icon.

[Image Description for Designer]: Imagine a vector graphic of a Southern Live Oak. The canopy is not individual leaves, but solid, flowing shapes (like a cloud). The trunk is thick. The ground beneath the tree isn't grass, but three distinct rectangular stones, symbolizing the hardscape focus. Color is #1F3A26 on a #F4F3EF background.

3. Website Information Architecture (IA)
The structure must communicate "Commercial" and "Heavy Construction" first. We are burying "gardening" to avoid attracting small residential lawn-mowing leads.

Primary CTA Button: [ Request Commercial Proposal ] (Color: Lowcountry Brick)

Secondary CTA: [ Residential Projects ] (Color: Transparent with Green Border)

Value Proposition Section
Header: "Rooted in Quality."

Point 3: Certified Arborists. "Protecting your largest natural assets with science-based tree care."

Service Buckets (Visual Grid)
Instead of listing "Mowing," use imagery that implies scale.

Image: An intricate stone patio. Label: "Architectural Hardscaping."

Image: A crane lifting a large tree section. Label: "Tree Removal & Care."

Image: A pristine office park entrance. Label: "Commercial Maintenance."
