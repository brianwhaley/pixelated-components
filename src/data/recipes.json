				"summary": [ "According to Wikipedia, Beef Stroganoff was invented by a chef working for a Russian general, Count Pavel Stroganov, in the 1890s. It became popular in the U.S. in the 1950s from servicemen returning from Europe and China after WWII. Beef Stroganoff is basically tender strips of beef and mushrooms cooked in a sour cream sauce and served over noodles, rice, or even French fries. You will want to make this with a tender cut of beef, such as tenderloin or top sirloin. For a quick version you can use ground beef instead of beef strips. You can also easily substitute yogurt for sour cream and leave out the mushrooms entirely." ],

Cashew Chicken can be found at many Chinese buffets across the country. This recipe for Cashew chicken consists of fried chicken bits with cashews and vegetables in a delicious oyster sauce. This recipe differs from others and those at the buffets because the chicken is breaded and then deep fried leaving the chicken pieces nice and crispy. The vegetables I added were green peppers, onions and scallions, but you could also add some sliced mushrooms as well if you want. Cashew Chicken is best served on top of white rice.  For a Bariatric-friendly version of this recipe, do not coat and fry the chicken - just cut into cubes or strips.  http://blogchef.net/cashew-chicken-recipe/" ],

				"summary": [ "Pizzelle are traditional Italian waffle cookies originally made in the Abruzzo region of south-central Italy. The name comes from the Italian word for 'round and flat' (pizze); this is also the meaning of the word pizza. Many other cultures have developed a pizzelle-type cookie as part of their culture. It is known to be one of the oldest cookies, and is believed to have developed from the ancient Roman crustulum. The cookie dough or batter is put into a pizzelle iron, which resembles a waffle iron. Typically, the iron stamps a snowflake pattern onto both sides of the thin golden-brown cookie, which has a crisp texture once it is cooled. Pizzelle are popular during Christmas and Easter. They are often found at Italian weddings, alongside other traditional pastries such as cannoli and traditional Italian cookies. It is also common for two pizzelle to be sandwiched with cannoli cream or hazelnut spread. Pizzelle, while still warm, can also be rolled using a wodden dowel to create cannoli shells.
